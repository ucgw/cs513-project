field notes:
  - id:
    each record has unique non-null values and thus is sufficient to be a PK for the table.
    #
    #
    > NOHEAD=1 ./quickref.py data/dirty/Dish.csv 0 423397 id | cut -d'|' -f1 | sort -u | wc -l
423397

    # > ./quickref.py data/dirty/Dish.csv 0 1 | grep record
records: 423397


    there are places where id isn't monotonically increasing by 1
    e.g.
    > NOHEAD=1 ./quickref.py data/dirty/Dish.csv 4 3 id
